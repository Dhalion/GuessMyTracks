# GuessMyTracks

This is a Game where a Song is played and the players have to guess its name and release year.  
If a player guesses right, they get a point. The player that first reaches 10 points wins.
The selection of tracks is based off the players spotify libraries. 
An extra point can be gained, if the player guesses correctly, from which players library the current track is from.
